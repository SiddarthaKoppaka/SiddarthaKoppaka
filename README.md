### **About Me**  

My work lives at the boundary between machine learning research and production systems. The projects here focus on applied AI, scalable data pipelines, and distributed architectures built with real-world constraints in mind.

From RAG-based systems to NLP applications and cloud-native ML workflows, each project reflects an emphasis on clean design, scalability, and long-term maintainability.
